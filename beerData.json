  "description" : "A bona fide English beer classic, English-style brown ale is easily one of the most iconic beer styles. Toasty, robust and with a bit of chocolate maltiness, the English brown ale is a meal in a glass, but offers unlimited opportunities for memorable food pairings. Neither flashy nor boring, the English brown is a beer with enough variation to keep devotees ordering them time and time again.English-style brown ales have two variations: a dry, roasted version that is said to have originated from northern England, and a sweeter, less attenuated brown ale variety that is believed to have gained favor in the southern portion of England. Both offer a toasted nut, chocolatey character indicative of brown ales. The English brown ale varieties will not be as hoppy or bitter as their American counterparts and favor English hops as well as characterful English ale yeast. Either style can be excellent with a variety of foods, particularly braised meats, but they are perfectly fine to be enjoyed on their own. The alcohol content of this beer is characteristically moderate and does not typically exceed 5.5 percent ABV.It’s safe to say that beer will never go out of style, but with all of the different forms of beer on the craft beer scene, it can be easy for brown ales to get pushed to the side. English-style brown ale is often one of those beers that people look past — but you should take the opportunity to try this traditional style when you’re at a craft brewery. With relatively low bitterness and two distinct varieties that best complement different pairings, it’s one of the most versatile English beers ever created. Whether you prefer sweeter or more hop-forward ales, there is an English brown ale that’s right for you.If you are in the mood to try one of these classic English brown ale beers, our “Find a Brewery” map can help you do precisely that. By entering your location, any particular state, or the name of a specific brewery, we can point you in the direction of the nearest brewery where you can find your next favorite beer, which could be a variation of an English-style brown ale.If you enjoy the website and are interested in a convenient way to learn more about English-style brown ale, or any other style of beer, sign up to have our newsletter delivered directly to your inbox.

  "description" : "The German-style dunkel is a bottom-fermented lager style beer. The word “dunkel” is German for “dark,” and this dark beer style offers beer lovers balanced flavors of chocolate, bread crust and caramel. The dunkel is a classic German lager that craft brewers are fond of brewing and countless people across the world are fond of enjoying. Like most German beers, dunkel beer is a great candidate for food pairing, matching up well to grilled meats.A German-style dunkel, sometimes referred to as a Munchner dunkel, should have an aroma comprised of chocolate roasted malt and bread or biscuit-like features that stem from the use of Munich malt. Despite the malt forward flavor profile, this beer does not offer an overly sweet impression. Rather, you’ll find a mild balance between the distinct character of malt and the refined touch of bitterness from noble hops, indicative of what many beer drinkers expect from German beer styles.Comprised of mostly Munich malt, the German dunkel’s caramelized malt experience is the product of a chemical process known as the Maillard reaction. This reaction is what lends Munich malt its distinctive bread crust flavor. While barley malt is kilned, the malt browns, creating a myriad of caramelized flavors. Browned proteins, like grilled pork chops and oven-browned bread both benefit from the Maillard reaction. Keep this in mind when you are pairing these types of foods with beers since dishes that showcase flavors derived from the Maillard reaction complement each other very well. These flavors are what make grilled pork chops a great meal to enjoy with a German dunkel beer.The CraftBeer.com “Find a Brewery” map is designed to help everyone from the craft beer connoisseur to the casual craft beer drinker find their first, or next, favorite brewery or brewpub.

These light and refreshing ale-lager hybrids are perfect for warm summer days and have become a favored style by American craft brewers and beer lovers alike. In addition to their thirst quenching ability, they also are a fun beer to enjoy with food, including traditional German sausages and kraut.The German-style Kolsch is light in color and malt character. This style’s fermentation process yields a light, vinous character which is accompanied by a slightly dry, crisp finish. Ale yeast is used for fermentation, though lager yeast is sometimes used in the bottle or final cold-conditioning process.Kolsch beer stems from Cologne (Koln), Germany, but has found its way onto America’s craft beer scene like many other German beers. Technically, for beer to be called a Kolsch, it has to come from the city of Cologne, but that hasn’t stopped American craft brewers from embracing the Kolsch style of beers. Craft beer connoisseurs have been enjoying American Kolsch style beers during the warm seasons since the Kolsch was introduced to the American craft scene. This beer style pairs best with bratwurst, nutty cheeses, and even lighter desserts like apricot cake.

  "description" : "Irish red ale is known for its unique malty taste and is on the lower side of the bitterness and alcohol content scales. If you love American craft beer, the Irish red ale beer remains a great style for beer lovers to seek out and appreciate.The Irish-style red ale is a balanced beer that uses a moderate amount of kilned malts and roasted barley in the recipe, which gives the beer the color for which it is named. Featuring an approachable hop bitterness which rests on the palate, this typically amber-colored beer is brewed as a lager or an ale, and can often have a medium, candy-like caramel malt sweetness. This style may contain adjuncts such as corn, rice, and sugar, which help dry out the beer’s finish and lessen the body. It also often contains roasted barley, lending low roasted notes, darker color and possible creation of a tan collar of foam on top. With notes of caramel, toffee and sometimes low-level diacetyl (butter), think of the Irish red ale beer style as a cousin to lightly-toasted and buttered bread.Irish-style red ales are an approachable style for people who are new to craft beer, but are also enjoyed and appreciated by even the most discerning of craft connoisseurs. Don’t let these tasty, sessionable beers be relegated to a once-a-year holiday, Irish style reds can be enjoyed throughout the year in a variety of occasions and with a lot of different food options.It’s no secret that Irish beers have played an influential role in the American craft beer scene, and that’s apparent through the Irish red ale beer. It can be challenging to keep up with all of the Irish beer reinventions, and that is why we’ve created an interactive “Find a Brewery” map.

The quest for more of the India pale ale flavor has led them to the imperial India pale ale, a stronger version of the American IPA, which boasts even more hoppy flavor, aroma and bitterness. Imperial India pale ale is darker in color than the American IPA, substantially more bitter, and high in alcohol by volume. This all-American take on the IPA leaves craft beer fans with plenty of new creations to try.The imperial India pale ale features high hop bitterness, flavor and aroma. Hop character is fresh and evident from the utilization of any variety of hops. Alcohol content is medium-high to high and notably evident with a medium-high to full body. This style intends to exhibit the fresh, evident character of hops.Craft beer has grown because of the curiosity that American craft brewers have exhibited through their tweaking of classic beer recipes. The love for the American IPA flavor that craft beer consumers have shown has led American craft brewers to the imperial IPA. The imperial IPA beer style creeps towards some of the strongest of ales in alcohol content, but the increase in hops from the original IPA beer recipe gives it a more bitter taste and doesn’t bring the same malt taste that barley wine does.

  "description" : "Strong, bitter and completely misunderstood, the English India pale ale (or English IPA) bridges the gap between past and present. No other style represents modern craft brewing excitement quite like the IPA, and while this English beer differs widely from the American version it inspires, this strong member of the English pale ale family has plenty of its own to offer — including all of the history behind this variety.Steeped in lore (and extra hops), the English-style IPA is a stronger version of a pale ale. The English-style pale ale is characterized by a hearty helping of English hop character (earthy, floral) and increased alcohol content. English yeast lend a fruity character to the flavor and aroma, offering a contrast to the earthy English hop additions. Different from its American counterpart, this style strikes a balance between malt and hops for a more rounded flavor.There is also a lot of mythology surrounding the creation of this style, which is still debated today. It is most commonly believed that English style pale ale was birthed from the need for a beer that could survive the journey to and from India, a land too warm for beer brewing without the aid of modern technology. The increased alcohol and hop contents would act as preservatives, giving IPAs the qualities that they are known for to this day. In actuality, the beer style that would become popularly known as an India pale ale bears little in common with the contemporary iteration you enjoy today. Additionally, beers similar to what made the trip to India had been in production for domestic consumption prior to any reports of it being exported and records show that other beer styles, including porter, made their way to the English colony of India and were enjoyed by parched soldiers and colonists.English pale ale beers, like the IPA, always offer great beer pairing opportunities. Strong English cheeses as well as grilled or braised meats, like pork, can make very tasty flavor experiences when paired with an English IPA. The higher alcohol, hops and carbonation all work to cut through fat and cleanse the palate, helping every bite be as tasty as the first.As popular as English beers, particularly IPAs, have become among beer lovers, we want to do our part to keep craft beers fans in the loop when it comes to these English beer styles.

  "description" : "Like most amber beers, American amber ale is named after the golden to amber color this American version of English pale ale exhibits. The color is derived from the use of caramel and crystal malt additions, which are roasted to provide amber beers with the color, body and flavor many beer fans have come to appreciate. Falling under the ale beer type, amber ales ferment at warmer temperatures for what is typically a much shorter amount of time than lager style beers.The American amber ale is one of the most widely enjoyed styles throughout the United States and serves as a cornerstone style of the American craft brewing revolution. American ambers are darker in color than their pale ale cousins, the presence of caramel and crystal malts lending a toasted, toffee flavor, along with the perception of a fuller body when compared to beers without such malts. Amber beer showcases a medium-high to high malt character with medium to low caramel character derived from the use of roasted crystal malts. The American amber is characterized by American-variety hops, which lend the amber ale notes of citrus, fruit and pine to balance the sweetness of the malt.As with many amber beer types, American amber ale is a highly versatile companion to American cuisine, particularly foods that are grilled or barbecued, as roasted malts complement seared, charred and caramelized proteins making this ale beer type a perennial favorite at backyard cookouts.The popularity of the American amber ale makes the style one of the easier amber beers to seek out at small and independent craft breweries or find in a local craft-centric retailer. Across the country, you can discover countless variations of the amber ale.

  "description" : "Like many others that have become known as classic American beers, the American pale ale can trace its roots to beer styles from abroad. The American pale ale beer was inspired by the English pale ale, replacing its English counterpart’s earthy, herbal hops with generous additions of boldly citrus and pine-like American varieties. As one of the most popular American beer styles, pale ale beer is not hard to track down, but the various takes on this iconic style by just as many American craft brewers makes it impossible to jam everything there is to know about American pale ale beer on one page, but we’ll do our best.Characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous American hops, the American pale ale is a medium-bodied beer with low to medium caramel, and carries with it a toasted maltiness. American pale ale is one of the most food-friendly styles to enjoy, since the pale ale works wonderfully with lighter fare such as salads and chicken, but can still stand up to a hearty bowl of chili; a variety of different cheeses, including cheddar; seafood, like steamed clams or fish, and even desserts. The American pale ale’s affinity to food can be attributed to the simplicity of its ingredients, which include toasty pale malt, a clean fermenting ale beer yeast, and the counterbalance of American hops to help tease out the flavor or cleanse the palate, preparing you for another bite.While pale ale beer has definitively English roots, many credit the American take on the style to the advent of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, which employs the use of American Cascade hops and a clean fermenting ale yeast that has become synonymous with today’s West Coast style craft beers. Currently, pale ales offer beer fans a balance between malt and hops, which make pale ales one of the most enjoyed and approachable beer styles available.American pale ale beer remains a staple of the American beer world because it continues to evolve. With each passing day, independent breweries across the country are reimagining the classic pale ale by experimenting with local ingredients to craft flavor profiles that push the boundaries of beer.

  "description" : "A beer for beer lovers, the German-style helles is a malt accented lager beer that balances a pleasant malt sweetness and body with floral Noble hops and restrained bitterness. The helles is a masterclass in restraint, subtly and drinkability which makes it an enduring style for true beer lovers and an elusive style for craft brewers to recreate. The German helles reminds beer lovers that the simple things in life are usually the most rewarding and worth pursuing.“Helles” means “pale in color,” as these beers are often golden. The German-style helles lager is a bit rounder or fuller-bodied than light lager and even all-malt pilsners. Helles lager beers offer a touch of sweetness that balance a measurable addition of spicy German hop flavor and light bitterness. The malt character is soft and bready, making it a terrific complement to light dishes such as salad or fresh shellfish, like clams. Clean and crisp, this is a refreshing beer with substance. Low levels of yeast-produced sulfur aromas and flavors may be common.While the German helles is highly versatile for pairing with food, helles lager is designed for refreshment and makes for the ideal beer on a hot day. Today, small and independent craft brewers offer their own takes on this classic German beer, many following the German tradition exactly, including German malts, spicy German hops and expertly controlled fermentation, offering a balanced yet subtly sweet lager beer. Others have added their own American twist on the helles variety by adding American hops and making this lager beer available in aluminum cans so beer lovers can enjoy this style while out and about. If you have not had the pleasure of tasting and appreciating this beer brewed for beer lovers, do yourself a favor and seek out a brewery near you that offers the style as a taproom option. You won’t be sorry.We’ve assembled an interactive “Find a Brewery” map to help you keep track of all of the breweries and brewpubs near you, and some of those craft breweries are likely making helles beer. By allowing the map to use your specific location, searching by state or searching for a specific brewery, we want to help you find your next favorite craft beer, which could be a helles beer.If you enjoy the website and are interested in a convenient way to learn more about German beer, sign up to have our newsletter delivered directly to your inbox.

  "description" : "Quite possibly the most iconic beer style in modern history, the pilsner — also spelled pilsener — captured the attention of beer drinkers across the world and inspired a myriad of regional imitations. This lightly colored, exquisitely balanced lager remains one of the most loved beers to enjoy, and one of the most challenging for the brewer to create. Pilsners are characteristically light in color and have a very short finish. The world over, pilsner-style lagers have become the standard beer for many reasons, and American craft brewers have worked hard to put their own unique spin on this classic German beer.A classic German-style pilsner is straw to pale in color with a malty sweetness that can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. Distinctly different from the Bohemian-style pilsner, this style is lighter in color and body and has a lower perceived hop bitterness.German pilsner lagers have a rich history in the United States. Some of the first breweries in the United States were started in the 1800s by German immigrants and specialized in brewing pilsner beer. Since then, American craft brewers have continued to experiment with the classic style pils. Like other German beers, pilsner lager’s crisp finish makes for a refreshing beer during the warmer months of the year. We want to help you find the next pilsner beer to keep you refreshed on a hot summer day.American craft brewers have worked hard to create their own versions of pilsner beers over the years.

You can look to pair coffee flavored beers with a wide variety of different foods. Desserts might be an obvious choice, after all, — who wouldn’t enjoy a piece of pecan pie cheesecake alongside a smooth, rich coffee oatmeal stout?
