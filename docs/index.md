# Cicerowned

## Deliverable 1

#### GitHub: https://github.com/allenjwelch/cicerowned_project
#### Heroku: https://cicerowned.herokuapp.com/

## Overview
  An educational web application designed to assist servers and beer drinkers alike in their pursuit of earning their Cicerone Certifications. There are solutions out there for wine certifications but not a lot of accessible test aids for Cicerone. This would be useful to most breweries and restaurants as they seek to develop employees to the first level of Cicerone.
